            Livestock plays a critical role in the agricultural ecosystem. 
            Identifying breeds accurately is essential for improving milk yield, 
            disease management, breeding programs, and conserving indigenous genetic resources. 
            Traditionally, breed identification requires expert knowledge and is prone to errors. 
            GoVed AI bridges this gap by offering a reliable digital solution that
            combines user-friendly design with powerful backend capabilities.
